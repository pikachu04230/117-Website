											<h3>GardenTalk: A Management Platform for Interaction between Humans, Landscapes and the Environment</h3>
											<p>
												<i><b>Author: 徐大賢</b></i><br>
												With the vigorous development of Internet of Things technology (IoT), IoT technology has been widely used in many fields, including smart home and smart agriculture. However, IoT solutions for original problems in landscape architecture have not been found. This paper proposes GardenTalk, an IoT device management system suitable for green spaces. Through this system, we can quickly build a smart park that can interact with people and the environment. With GardenTalk, managers can efficiently complete the original work, the environment can avoid unnecessary energy consumption, and users can gain extensive experience through multiple methods. In the future, GardenTalk can play a connecting role in the development of smart cities. The green space managed by GardenTalk is like a dot; When dots connect to a plane, it becomes the prototype of a smart city. This thesis elaborates on the design and related applications of GardenTalk. The system is practically used in NCTU and other related fields.

											<h3>Automatic deployment of a cloud-based physics experiment platform and processing of large scale physics experiment data</h3>
											<p>
												<i><b>Author: 陳瑩穎</b></i><br>
												EduTalk, a 3D interactive programming education platform with IoT, enables heterogeneous connection for different sensors and provides users to do physics experiments on it. But it lacks the functions to process large scale physics experiment data. Therefore, in this thesis, we describe how to record large scale physics experiment data in EduTalk with the FileLogger device and to export them to the Excel files and download the export file to localhost through the DataBank management module for user to do further analysis.<br>
												Since we need to provide users with computing and service resources, cloud-based platform is a suitable solution. In this thesis, we describe how to implement the Automatic deployment CLI for users to easily deploy a cloud-based physics experiment platform and operate the cloud virtual machines (VMs) in their CHT Hicloud account.

											<h3>EduTalk: A 3D Interactive Programming Education Platform with IoT</h3>
											<p>
												<i><b>Author: 胡育旋</b></i><br>
												In recent years, programming education becomes important worldwide, and programming course has been compulsory for high school students in Taiwan. However, it takes a lot of time to setup environment. We propose EduTalk, an out-of-the-box web-based education platform. Users may write VPython programs to render 3D animation in the browser without installing software or purchasing any hardware. The EduTalk system will automatically create a unique QR Code for each lecture, then user can scan the QR Code with their smartphone to control the 3D animation using smartphone sensors. The core idea of creating a connection between the user's smartphone and the animation is utilizing the IoT concept. A smartphone is considered as a collection of sensors, and the 3D animation program may be considered as a collection of actuators. With IoT features, programming education can also be combined with other fields. For example, user may use smartphone sensors as physics experiment tool. EduTalk is capable of replaying the smartphone movement in animation to help students derive the formula. In this thesis, we will show how we manage lectures, provide online editor, and manage IoT devices and connections.

											<h3>Design and Implementation of an Energy-Saving Scheduling Algorithm for Elevator Group Control System Using ElevatorTalk</h3>
											<p>
												<i><b>Author: 趙子翔</b></i><br>
												This thesis proposes the Energy-Saving Scheduling Algorithm for Elevator Group Control that uses a shortest-path calculation as the determination for dispatching a proper car when the passenger arrives. The two performance metrices that we consider simultaneously are the average passenger journey time (i.e. the duration between the passenger arrives until he/she leaves the elevator) and the energy consumption. There are various previously proposed algorithms that paid their attentions to saving the average passenger journey time; however, the energy consumption is rarely considered. Nowadays, environmental friendliness has had been seriously considered. We show the tradeoff between the energy saving and the journey time. The proposed algorithm saves the energy by 30% to 50%, while increasing the average passenger journey time by 5% to 25 % on different passenger arrival traffic pattern.

											<h3>Integration of Internet of Things and Aquaculture Technologies</h3>
											<p>
												<i><b>Author: 曾浤鈞</b></i><br>
												Over fishing has caused the depletion of marine resources, so the new technology for aquaculture is essential. This dissertation proposes a fishing farm system (including sensors, actuators, and cameras) that integrates Internet of Things (IoT) technologies and telecommunications networks (including LTE and WLAN aggregation technologies (LWA) and narrow-band Internet of Things (NB-IoT)). In addition, take the possible large-scale deployment into consideration in the future, we develop a management platform (NB-IoTtalk) to manage multiple sets of water quality monitors at the same time.<br>
												In order to monitor multiple cameras at the same time, we studied the LWA to guarantee the large downlink bandwidth. LWA combines the radio resources of Long Term Evolution (LTE) and WLAN to make its packets be delivered through either LTE or WLAN. Since the LTE base station periodically receives the measurement report from the user equipment (UE) that reports the quality of the WLAN signal, we propose a simple LTE-to-WLAN Ratio (LWR) rule based on the WLAN’s Received Signal Strength Indicator (RSSI). We also show the user plane of the LWA and implement the LWA offloading algorithm on the LTE base station. Furthermore, we investigate the performance of periodical reporting, and then propose the enhanced event-triggered reporting to improve the performance of WLAN transmission rate adaption.<br>
												Since NB-IoT technology is adopted, developers need to create "web applications" that connect to NB-IoT servers. However, many outdoor IoT applications involve large numbers of homogeneous NB-IoT devices, and it is tedious to specify and accommodate these devices in application development. Therefore based on a labeling mechanism, we propose the NB-IoTtalk service platform for rapid development of NB-IoT applications.<br>
												In addition to verify the feasibility of our approach, we implement the system on an aquarium box. We proposed the FishTalk system and integrated the video simultaneously. In the system, the user can remotely operate the actuators and use the surveillance camera to confirm that the actuators is functioning properly. The system allows the aquarium sensors to drive the actuators in real time and its software can be directly reused in a large-scale fish farm after appropriate replacement of the actuators and parameter setting.<br>

											<h3>ElevatorTalk: A Smart Elevator Platform and Its Extension to Other Applications</h3>
											<p>
												<i><b>Author: 吳宗翰</b></i><br>
												This dissertation proposes ElevatorTalk, an elevator development and management system based on an IoT approach called IoTtalk. This system modularizes the software into elevator components so that flexible and scalable car scheduling algorithms can be developed. ElevatorTalk consists of three subsystems: Cars, Scheduler and the Elevator Car Operating (ECO) Panel. ECO Panel receive the requests issued by the passengers. Scheduler subsystem is responsible of scheduling the car group controlled by Cars subsystem. These three subsystems work in parallel, and communicate with each other through sending and receiving wired/wireless messages. Due to the IoT communication and system is modular design, ElevatorTalk can be a real elevator management center and emulate existing elevator systems with different car scheduling algorithms. Based on ElevatorTalk, we propose an intelligent aggressive car scheduling with initial car distribution algorithm (ACSICD) and an energy-saving scheduling algorithm. Our study indicates that ACSICD has better waiting/travel/journey time performance and/or accuracy than the previous proposed algorithms. It also illustrates that the Energy-Saving scheduling algorithm outperforms ACSICD with energy consumption reductions by 49.43%, 47.68%, 37.89%, and 47.65% for up-peak, inter-floor, down-peak, and all-day request patterns, respectively and still has acceptable performance on waiting/journey time. These two scheduling algorithm also demonstrate the ability of ElevatorTalk.
